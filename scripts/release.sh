Pass the following arguments:

	* \`<repo>\`: ":user/:name" of the repository. For example, "foca/mpp".
	* \`<tag>\`: Name of the tag for this release. For example, "v1.0.0".
	* \`<release name>\`: Optional suffix for the release name.

You can pass a list of files to upload as release assets by giving them after a
\`--\` argument.

If you supply text on \`STDIN\` it will be used as the release notes.

EXAMPLES:

	$ $0 foca/mpp v1.0.0 -- pkg/*.tar.gz

	Creates a release named "mpp v1.0.0" and adds any tar.gz file in
	\`./pkg\` as an asset.

	$ $0 foca/mpp v1.0.1 "Bugfixes" -- pkg/*.tar.gz < notes.md

	Creates a release named "mpp v1.0.1: Bugfixes", adds any tar.gz
	file in \`./pkg\` as an asset, and uses the contents of \`notes.md\`
	as the release notes.

NOTE:

This uses your \`.netrc\` file to authenticate with GitHub. In order to run the
script, make sure you have **both** \`api.github.com\` and \`uploads.github.com\` in
this file. For example:

machine api.github.com
  login foca
  password <an access token>
machine uploads.github.com
  login foca
  password <an access token>

Generate this access token at https://github.com/settings/tokens and make sure
it has access to the \`"repo"\` scope.
